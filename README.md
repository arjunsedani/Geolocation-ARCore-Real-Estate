# Geolocation-ARCore
The application serves as a base for any developer to build their own Geolocation AR app. The basic concept of the app is to help a user identify a certain building or location. When the user points their camera at a building, a 3D object like a wooden sign representing the direction and name of the building, is augmented onto their camera view. The user can view this object from any angle, interact with it by touching it for further information about the location. The sample app developed as proof of concept is a UCSC tour app that helps new UCSC students identify cafes, libraries, parking spots and academic building all around campus.
The documentation for this project is available in the report GeoAR.pdf
